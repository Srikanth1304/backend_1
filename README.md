This is about the task that I did... It is about basic funda of backend using js (express).
In data trasfer Express takes the responsiblity of Transfering Requesting and responsiblity .It is a Fast, Unopinionated, minimalist web frame work for node.js .The main aim is to Listen the tasks like /login, /instagram,  etc in the particular port 
Firstly package.json is created with "npm init" or default condition of "npm init -y" 
Install npm express 
Keep index.js file

For production,If specified port in users env, port num has to change manually, for this 
    npm install i dotenv
    create .env file    (place things that will depend on users env like port num and databaseurl etc..  ) for implementing it visit dotenv url
